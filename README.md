# SMFA

SMFA is a general program package for performing quantum chemistry calculations on large
molecules, using an energy-based fragmentation approach. The program can calculate
electronic energies, energy gradients and second derivatives; perform geometry
optimization; find first order saddle points (transition states); perform energy optimized
scans along a user-defined path; and evaluate various molecular properties. The program
can use any of the following quantum chemistry packages: GAMESS(US), GAUSSIAN,
NWChem and Q-Chem. In addition, SMFA provides a number of utility programs that, inter
alia, calculate vibrational frequencies and infrared spectra with isotopic substitutions, the
electrostatic potential on the solvent-accessible-surface, and isodesmic and higher order
near-iso-energetic reaction schemes. Calculations of the electronic energy and related
properties can be carried out using a scheme that provides a computation time that is
linearly dependent on the size of the molecule or, if the user has enough processing units
available, in a computation time that is independent of the size of the molecule.
