The GDMA program carries out distributed multipole analysis of
wavefunctions calculated by the Gaussian system of programs, using the 
formatted checkpoint files that they produce.

To unpack the distribution file, put it in a suitable directory and
run the commands
        gunzip gdma-2.1.tar
        tar xvf gdma-2.1.tar
The files will be unpacked into a new gdma-2.1 directory. Change to
this directory.

If you are working on a PC under Linux, you can use the program
executable in gdma-2.1/bin/gdma. Otherwise, check that the settings in
the Makefile are appropriate for your Fortran90 compiler, and 
        make
If the compilation is successful, the new executable will be in
gdma-2.1/bin/gdm, overwriting the supplied version.

Use
        make test
to run the test files through the program. The test script checks
whether the output is correct. If all is well,
        make install
will put the executable in /usr/local/bin. You will probably have to
be root to do that. Change the definition of INSTALL_DIR in the
Makefile if necessary.

The detailed documentation is in the file doc/manual.pdf.
