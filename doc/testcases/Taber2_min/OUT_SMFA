A description of the fragments can be found in file frags.out
The coordinates of the fragments in xyz format are contained
in seefrags (in suitable format for graphics).

  The number of fragments is
          45
 
  The largest number of electrons in a fragment
  is           98  for fragment number           14

            PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION
 
  The bulk of the cputime is employed in performing
  electronic structure calculations for the many
  molecular fragments, and for fragment properties that
  are needed to evaluate the non-bonded interactions.
  For these calculations, the recommended number of
  cpus for maximum efficiency and and minimum walltime
  is
 
          14
 
  This assumes that each fragment uses only 1 cpu.
 
  The user sets the number of cpus in main menu item 4
 
  The user can specify less than           14  cpus,
  for example, if only a smaller number is available.
