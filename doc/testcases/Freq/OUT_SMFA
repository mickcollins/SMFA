The molecular coordinates are in file
optMP2L3dtol1.1c-cyclotridecene.xyz
The number of atoms in the molecule is
37


             EXAMINATION of the MOLECULAR COORDINATES shows:

  The total molecular charge =            0


 The following metal-containing groups were found
 Check that the metal charge is correct

             FRAGMENTATION RESULTS

A description of the fragments can be found in file frags.out
The coordinates of the fragments in xyz format are contained
in seefrags (in suitable format for graphics).

 Total numbers of atoms and electrons:           37         102
  The number of fragments is
          24
 
  The largest number of electrons in a fragment
  is           40  for fragment number            9
 
An ab initio input file for this fragment is contained in
LARGE.com or LARGE.inp or LARGE.nw
 
 
            PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION
 
  The bulk of the cputime is employed in performing
  electronic structure calculations for the many
  molecular fragments, and for fragment properties that
  are needed to evaluate the non-bonded interactions.
  For these calculations, the recommended number of
  cpus for maximum efficiency and and minimum walltime
  is
 
          23
 
  This assumes that each fragment uses only 1 cpu.
 
  The user sets the number of cpus in main menu item 4
 
  The user can specify less than           23  cpus,
  for example, if only a smaller number is available.
