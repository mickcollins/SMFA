             FRAGMENTATION RESULTS

A description of the fragments can be found in file frags.out
The coordinates of the fragments in xyz format are contained
in seefrags (in suitable format for graphics).

 Total numbers of atoms and electrons:           35         148
  The number of fragments is
          17
 
  The largest number of electrons in a fragment
  is           60  for fragment number            4
 
An ab initio input file for this fragment is contained in
LARGE.com or LARGE.inp or LARGE.nw
 
 
            PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION
 
  The bulk of the cputime is employed in performing
  electronic structure calculations for the many
  molecular fragments, and for fragment properties that
  are needed to evaluate the non-bonded interactions.
  For these calculations, the recommended number of
  cpus for maximum efficiency and and minimum walltime
  is
 
           7
 
  This assumes that each fragment uses only 1 cpu.
 
  The user sets the number of cpus in main menu item 4
 
  The user can specify less than            7  cpus,
  for example, if only a smaller number is available.
 

                      Near isoenergetic reactions

For the molecule contained in file TAXYIA.xyz, an almost isoenergetic reaction
has been found, corresponding to a Level = 1 fragmentation.

 The Cartesian coordinates for each Fragment are listed
 in the file seefrags.

 In addition, files describing the lhs and rhs of the reaction have been created
 under the file names

 TAXYIA.xyz.lhs.inichi
 TAXYIA.xyz.lhs.coeff
 TAXYIA.xyz.lhs.coords
 TAXYIA.xyz.lhs.svg
 TAXYIA.xyz.rhs.inichi
 TAXYIA.xyz.rhs.coeff
 TAXYIA.xyz.rhs.coords
 TAXYIA.xyz.rhs.svg

 Files with '.inichi' list the Inchi for each compound
 Files with '.coeff' list the coefficient of the compound in the reaction formula
 Files with '.coords' list the Cartesian coordinates of the compounds, visualised with VMD etc
 Files with '.svg can be opended with a web browser like FireFox to give a table of
 of 2D drawings of the compounds

The TAXYIA.xyz.lhs... and TAXYIA.xyz.rhs...  files can be used with another utility in SMFA
to construct more 'near isoenergetic' reactions - see the User's manual
