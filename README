Installation Instructions for SMFA on Linux systems.


(1) The SMFAPAC/bin directory must be on the user's path, which can be achieved by adding 
the following to the appropriate rc file: 

For ~/.cshrc:

set path = ( $path /path/to/SMFAPAC/bin)

For ~/.bashrc:

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/SMFAPAC/bin

Ensure /path/to is replaced with the actual path to the directory.

(2) The following two compilers and one library must be on the user's path:
	intel-fc
	intel-mkl
	intel-cc

(3) The user must ensure that the Cmake program is available.

(4) Perl must be installed.

(5) The user has to provide access to at least one of 
GAMESS(US), 
GAUSSIAN, 
NWChem, or 
QChem,
 
and also to DALTON.

	The SMFA_Users_Guide.pdf (Section 2.7) in SMFAPAC/doc contains information about how SMFA 
needs to be told (in Main Menu Item 4) how to "load" each (at least one) of these quantum chemistry packages.

(6) One of the optional utility programs in SMFA requires the openbabel program 
(see Section 5.2 in SMFA_Users_Guide.pdf), so you will need to install openbabel if you want to use 
this feature. You can install openbabel at any time (the build below does not require it).

(7) Once the above preliminaries are complete, the user simply executes the following commands

cd SMFAPAC
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make 
make install

Comment
	The build is out-of-source, which means that all the object files are created in subdirectories 
of the build directory. You can 'make clean' or simply delete the entire build directory if you want to 
start from scratch again. When you 'make install' all the compiled binaries are moved to the exe directory 
in the SMFAPAC directory.

(8) If you have not already done so, copy the SMFA_Users_Guide.pdf in SMFAPAC/doc to somewhere you can 
read pdf files. The User's Guide contains detailed instructions on how to use SMFA.
