pbsdsh -n node  -- bash -l -c 


NOTE: Some computer systems require special instructions in order to
use more cpus than are available in one node.

The first line in this file must contain that special instruction that
PRECEEDS the command that will be executed on each cpu. 

For example in the authors system, the COMPLETE instruction to execute
the command "examplescript" would be

pbsdsh -n node  -- bash -l -c examplescript

SMFA will automatically complete the whole instruction as necessary.

The user MUST enter the appropriate instruction on the first line of
this file (replacing the first line above).

NOTE: SMFA will replace "node" above with an integer that counts cpus, beginning
wth 1, 2, 3,.......,$PBS_NCPUS. So, if your system instruction contains such
a counter, you must use "node" to represent this counter.

NOTE: If your system has no special instruction for using multiple nodes, you can simply
LEAVE THE FIRST LINE IN THIS FILE BLANK.
